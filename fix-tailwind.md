# Fix Tailwind Installation

Please follow these steps to fix Tailwind:

1. Delete these files/folders:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
```

2. Run clean install:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Stop any running dev server and restart:
```bash
npm run dev
```

If styles are still not working:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Try a hard refresh (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R)
3. Check the browser console for any errors

The configuration has been fixed to:
- Remove duplicate CSS imports
- Fix the Tailwind config closing brace
- Simplify PostCSS configuration
- Remove unnecessary Vite optimizations
