# Fixing Tailwind CSS Issues

The Tailwind styles are not working due to some package configuration issues. Here are the steps to fix this:

1. Remove the incorrect package:
```bash
npm remove @tailwindcss/vite
```

2. Fix the package versions in package.json. Update these versions:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  }
}
```

3. Reinstall the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Restart the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The configuration files are now correct:
- tailwind.config.js has the proper content configuration
- postcss.config.js is properly set up
- index.css has the correct Tailwind imports

After making these changes, the Tailwind styles should work correctly. The issue was primarily caused by:
1. An incorrect package (@tailwindcss/vite) that doesn't exist
2. Incorrect React version numbers that could cause dependency conflicts
